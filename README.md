# ❤️ Heart Disease Classification Model



## 📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a **Heart Disease Classification Model** that predicts whether a patient has heart disease based on clinical and diagnostic data.  
Using **machine learning techniques**, the system analyzes medical features such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol, and other health indicators to assist healthcare professionals in **early diagnosis and prevention**.

The project uses Python and multiple supervised learning algorithms, comparing their performance to identify the most accurate model.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Predict the presence or absence of heart disease (binary classification).  
- Analyze relationships between medical features and disease likelihood.  
- Experiment with multiple classification algorithms for best accuracy.  
- Support healthcare professionals with data-driven diagnostic insights.    

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was performed using **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** to identify patterns and feature importance.  

- Age and heart disease correlation  
- Gender-based distribution of cases  
- Fasting blood sugar vs. heart disease occurrence  
- Cholesterol and blood pressure visualizations
